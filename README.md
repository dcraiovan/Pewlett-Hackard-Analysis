# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
Module 7 Challenge - SQL

# Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to determine the number of retiring employees by title and identify which employees are eligible to participate in the mentorship program. Our retiring employees by title information will show the titles of all employees born between January, 1 1965 and December, 31 1965. 

The tables and summaries were created using different functions and clauses in SQL. Amongs them we used WHERE, DISTINCT, JOIN, ORDER BY and COUNT.

# Results
- The retirment titles shows every employee eligible for retirement and how long they have worked at each position over the course of their career.

- The unique titles shows the most recent title for employees of retirment age.

- The retiring titles table shows that 64% of employees of retirment age (57,668/90,398) have senior titles; senior engineer and senior staff.

- The final part of our project shows mentorship eligibility, if you look at the head of the new csv - you can see that most of these employees have senior titles.

# Summary

As the analyses shows, 63 % of the workforce is either retirment or mentorship eligible therefore many positions will require to be filed over the next 5-10 years. There may not exactly be enough people in the workforce to take care of the tasks or even come close to the amount of experience to fill these roles so quickly but what companies can do is try to start recruiting and do knowledge tranfers before the silver tsunami happens.
